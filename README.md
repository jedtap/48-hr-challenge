# 48 hour challenge!

Last January 2022, a potential employer sent me an invitation to take on their 48-hour challenge. The senior engineer informed me that I'll be creating a web application using different technologies listed below. After a few emails, I said yes to the challenge. 

I was tasked to create a Facebook group application. Think of Facebook, but just the group functionality - people can post, comment, and reply to those comments. After coding from January 28 to 29, I am grateful on how the deployment turned out!
